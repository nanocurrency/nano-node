/*

  Flatbuffers schema for the Banano IPC API.

  This file contains IPC message definitions from which code and other artifacts are
  generated.

  Rules for editing this file:

   - Only append or deprecate fields; never rearrange or remove fields. This ensures
     binary backwards- and forwards compatibility.

   - Renaming fields retain binary compatibility, but should still be considered
     a breaking change in most cases. This is because the old name may be expected
     in JSON messages and generated API accessors (which may lead to issues in dynamic
     languages)

   - Renaming a message is considered a breaking change, as the name appears in endpoints
     and JSON message envelopes.

   - Use 64-bit integer types only when the value fits in 2^53-1. This ensures exact
     values in all supported bindings, including Javascript (which only supports the
     double type) As an example, timestamps such as milliseconds-since-epoch can be
     used safely.

   - For integers larger than 2^53-1 where full precision is needed, use a string. Numbers
     in strings are considered big int or big decimal, balances being a prominent example.

   - Use the naming pattern SomeMessageName for requests, and SomeMessageNameResponse for
     responses if an existing response type isn't available.

   - Subscribe messages must be prefixed Topic and messages belonging to a subscription
     must be prefixed Event. Using confirmations as an example, this means using the
     message names TopicConfirmation and EventConfirmation respectively.

   - Includes and multiple namespaces must not be used yet due to known issues with
     language bindings.

   - Do not use Flatbuffer structs, these are much harder to evolve and the benefits
     are minor.

   - Use the (required) attribute only when it's obvious it will never be optional in
     the future. Required fields make it harder to obtain full compatibility.

  Other considerations:

   - If a message accrue many deprecations, consider making a minor-versioned message.
     This should be done through nominal typing, i.e. a new message type with a suffix
     indicating the version, like AccountWeight_v2_1. The response type can be an existing
     type, but can also be versioned in the same manner. This naming pattern may be used
     for endpoint mapping in the future, such as /api/v2_1/AccountWeight.

   - If several messages need refactoring or improvements, a new API version should be
     considered. This requires establishing a new endpoint (e.g. /api/v3)
     New and old versions can co-exist.

  Note that none of these rules apply to APIs considered internal, as these are versioned
  by their enclosing binary. That is, all binaries (node, rpc, wallet, etc) using internal
  APIs are expected to be upgraded at the same time and are thus versioned together. The
  same relaxation applies to fields and messages considered "debug" or "experimental".

  See also https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/md__schemas.html for recommended
  schema evolution practices.
