 *
 *  The container consists of a number of buckets. Each bucket holds an ordered set of 'value_type' items.
 *  The buckets are accessed in a round robin fashion. The index 'current' holds the index of the bucket to access next.
 *  When a block is inserted, the bucket to go into is determined by the account balance and the priority inside that
 *  bucket is determined by its creation/arrival time.
 *
 *  The arrival/creation time is only an approximation and it could even be wildly wrong,
 *  for example, in the event of bootstrapped blocks.
