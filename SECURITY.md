# Security Policy

## Active Versions

The Nano network is designed to allow peering between multiple versions of the node software, with older versions being periodically de-peered. The active versions currently peering and being supported can be found in the Node Releases page of our documentation: https://docs.nano.org/releases/node-releases/

## Security Audit

In December 2018 the Nano node codebase was audited by Red4Sec and found to have no critical vulnerabilities. The following vulnerability was resolved:

**Risk**: High  
**Report Location**: Pages 34-35  
**Resolution**: [Pull Request #1563](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/1563) in [release V17.1](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/releases/tag/V17.1)  

All other notices from the report were classified as informative and are continuously improved on over time (e.g. code styling). The full report is available here: https://content.nano.org/Nano_Final_Security_Audit_v3.pdf
