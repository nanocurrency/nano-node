# This class has a member variable that is marked alignas(16) which means the object should be aligned an a 16-byte boundary which it isn’t.
# Looking at where it’s instantiated it’s a static local function variable that is also thread_local.
# This could be some sort of bug in the thread_local alignment, maybe in combination with being a static local function variable.
# This issue is only reproducible on the GitHub MacOS UBSAN runners.
